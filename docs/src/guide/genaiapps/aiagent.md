# Smart AI Agent - LangChain + RAG + DeepEval
This section outlines the steps to create an intelligent AI agent that uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with multi-source information retrieval and comprehensive evaluation using the DeepEval framework


## Introduction
I'm building a conversational AI agent that leverages **LangChain's ReAct framework** with support for both **local Llama3 LLM** and **Claude (Anthropic)** to converse intelligently with users. The agent has access to multiple information sources - a **ChromaDB vector database** for stored knowledge and **DuckDuckGo web search** for current information. The agent follows a smart search strategy: it first queries the knowledge base for relevant information, and if that's insufficient, it searches the web for up-to-date data. All of this is wrapped in an interactive **Streamlit UI** and rigorously evaluated using the **DeepEval testing framework** with comprehensive metrics

Let's start with building the application

## Prerequisites
This application supports two LLM options:

1. **Local Llama3** - I've used the local Llama3 as one LLM option, running via Ollama
2. **Claude (Anthropic)** - Cloud-based LLM option requiring an API key

For DeepEval testing, you'll need an **OpenAI API key** as DeepEval uses OpenAI models for evaluation metrics

## Architecture Overview

The agent consists of several key components working together:

- **SmartAgent**: The core agent using LangChain's ReAct pattern for decision-making
- **VectorDBManager**: Manages ChromaDB with HuggingFace embeddings for semantic search
- **WebSearchManager**: Handles DuckDuckGo searches with query optimization and result caching
- **AgentTools**: Provides tools for knowledge base search, web search, time queries, and data storage
- **Config**: YAML-based configuration management for flexible setup

## Setup Vector Database for Knowledge Storage

The first step is to set up a vector database for storing and retrieving knowledge. I'm using **ChromaDB** as the vector store with **HuggingFace embeddings** for semantic encoding. The embedding model used is **all-MiniLM-L6-v2**, which provides a good balance between performance and accuracy

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

class VectorDBManager:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.embedding_model = config.get("vector_db.embedding_model")
        self.embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=self.embedding_model)
        
        self.vectorstore = Chroma(
            collection_name=self.collection_name,
            embedding_function=self.embeddings,
            persist_directory=self.persist_directory
        )
```

The vector database supports:
- **Semantic search** with similarity scoring
- **Focused search** with relevance filtering to return only highly relevant documents
- **Document storage** with metadata tagging for categorization
- **Persistent storage** on disk for data retention across sessions

I've implemented a **focused search** method that uses relevance scoring to filter out irrelevant results:

```python
def search_similar_focused(self, query: str) -> str:
    """Search for the most relevant document with smart filtering"""
    docs = self.vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)
    
    # Simple relevance check
    query_words = [word for word in query_lower.split() if len(word) > 2]
    relevance_score = sum(1 for word in query_words if word in content_lower)
    
    if relevance_score > 0:
        return best_doc.page_content
    else:
        return "No highly relevant documents found in the knowledge base"
```

## Configure Web Search Capability

To provide access to current information, I've integrated **DuckDuckGo search** with intelligent query optimization. The web search manager includes:

- **Query optimization** - Removes unnecessary words and enhances search terms
- **Search type detection** - Identifies if query is news, academic, comparison, or general
- **Result caching** - Stores recent searches to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents excessive search requests with minimum intervals
- **Content processing** - Extracts and formats relevant information from results

```python
class WebSearchManager:
    def search_web(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Check cache first
        cached_result = self._get_cached_result(query)
        if cached_result:
            return cached_result
        
        # Determine search type and strategy
        search_type = self._determine_search_type(query)
        
        # Perform enhanced search
        raw_results = self._perform_search(query, search_type)
        
        # Process and format results
        enhanced_result = self._process_and_format_results(raw_results, query)
        
        return enhanced_result
```

The search type detection enhances queries based on intent:

```python
def _determine_search_type(self, query: str) -> str:
    """Determine the type of search based on query content"""
    query_lower = query.lower()
    
    if any(word in query_lower for word in ["latest", "recent", "news", "current"]):
        return "news"
    elif any(word in query_lower for word in ["research", "study", "paper"]):
        return "academic"
    elif any(word in query_lower for word in ["compare", "vs", "difference"]):
        return "comparison"
    else:
        return "general"
```

## Build the Agent Tools

The agent has access to **5 comprehensive tools** that enable it to answer a wide variety of queries:

1. **search_knowledge_base** - Searches the vector database for stored information (used FIRST)
2. **search_web** - Searches the web for current information (when KB is insufficient)
3. **get_current_time** - Returns current date and time
4. **add_to_knowledge_base** - Stores new information for future reference
5. **get_database_stats** - Retrieves knowledge base statistics

```python
class AgentTools:
    def create_tools(self) -> List[Tool]:
        return [
            Tool(
                name="search_knowledge_base",
                description="Search the knowledge base for stored information. Use this FIRST for any query.",
                func=search_knowledge_base
            ),
            Tool(
                name="search_web", 
                description="Search the web for current information. Use when knowledge base doesn't have sufficient information.",
                func=search_web
            ),
            Tool(
                name="get_current_time",
                description="Get the current date and time",
                func=get_current_time
            ),
            # ... other tools
        ]
```

## Create the ReAct Agent

The agent uses **LangChain's ReAct framework** which follows a thought-action-observation loop to solve problems. The agent thinks about what to do, takes an action using one of its tools, observes the result, and repeats until it has the final answer

### Setup LLM

The agent supports two LLM options configured via YAML:

```python
def _initialize_llm(self):
    """Initialize the language model"""
    llm_type = self.config.get("llm.default_type", "llama")
    
    if llm_type.lower() == "claude":
        return ChatAnthropic(
            anthropic_api_key=api_key,
            model=self.config.get("llm.claude.model"),
            temperature=0.1
        )
    elif llm_type.lower() == "llama":
        return OllamaLLM(
            model=self.config.get("llm.llama.model"),
            temperature=0.1
        )
```

I chose **temperature of 0.1** for both models to ensure deterministic and focused responses, which is important for factual question-answering tasks

### Setup Agent Prompt

The agent follows a clear search strategy defined in its prompt:

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""You are a helpful AI assistant with access to multiple information sources. Follow this search strategy:

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. For any question, FIRST search your knowledge base
2. If knowledge base doesn't have sufficient info, search the web for current information
3. Use reasoning to synthesize information from multiple sources when needed

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do next
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat as needed)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!

Question: {input}
Thought:{agent_scratchpad}""")
```

This prompt format is crucial - it explicitly guides the ReAct agent through the reasoning process

### Setup Agent Executor

The agent executor manages the agent's execution with configurable parameters:

```python
agent = create_react_agent(llm=self.llm, tools=self.tools, prompt=prompt)

return AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=self.tools,
    verbose=True,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
    max_iterations=40
)
```

I've set **max_iterations to 40** to allow for complex multi-step reasoning, and enabled **handle_parsing_errors** to gracefully manage any formatting issues from the LLM

## Initialize with Sample Data

The agent comes pre-loaded with sample data covering various topics to demonstrate its capabilities:

```python
def initialize_with_sample_data(self):
    """Load comprehensive sample data"""
    sample_docs = [
        "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides tools for building agents, chains, and retrieval systems.",
        "Python is a popular programming language for AI development, offering libraries like LangChain, OpenAI, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and HuggingFace Transformers.",
        "Streamlit is a Python library for creating web applications for machine learning and data science projects.",
        "JP Morgan Chase is one of the largest banks in the United States, offering investment banking, financial services, and asset management.",
        "AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.",
        "Vector databases store high-dimensional vectors and enable similarity search. They're essential for RAG systems.",
        "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from experience."
    ]
    
    metadata = [
        {"source": "langchain_docs", "topic": "framework", "type": "technical"},
        {"source": "programming_guide", "topic": "python", "type": "technical"},
        {"source": "streamlit_docs", "topic": "web_framework", "type": "technical"},
        {"source": "financial_info", "topic": "banking", "type": "business"},
        {"source": "ai_concepts", "topic": "agents", "type": "technical"},
        {"source": "vector_db_guide", "topic": "database", "type": "technical"},
        {"source": "ai_concepts", "topic": "machine_learning", "type": "technical"}
    ]
    
    return self.vector_db.add_documents(sample_docs, metadata)
```

## Build Interactive UI with Streamlit

I've used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as my UI framework to create an engaging chat interface with additional features for managing the agent. Its simple, open source and helpful in building interactive data-based applications with zero to minimal front-end experience

### Features:
- **LLM Selection** - Switch between Llama3 and Claude in the sidebar
- **Agent Configuration** - Initialize agent with custom settings
- **Chat Interface** - Conversational UI with message history and chat bubbles
- **Tools Dashboard** - View available tools and their descriptions in a table
- **Vector Database Viewer** - Browse and search stored documents with metadata
- **Document Addition** - Add new documents with custom metadata through a form
- **Agent Stats** - Monitor LLM type, tool count, and database size in real-time

### Sidebar Configuration:

```python
def render_sidebar():
    """Render the sidebar with configuration and stats"""
    st.sidebar.title("🤖 Agent Configuration")
    
    # LLM Selection
    llm_type = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        "Select LLM",
        ["llama", "claude"],
        index=0
    )
    
    # API Key input for Claude
    if llm_type == "claude":
        api_key = st.sidebar.text_input("Anthropic API Key", type="password")
    
    # Initialize Agent button
    if st.sidebar.button("Initialize Agent"):
        st.session_state.agent = SmartAgent(config=st.session_state.config)
        st.session_state.agent.initialize_with_sample_data()
```

### Main Chat Interface:

```python
def render_chat_interface():
    """Render the main chat interface"""
    st.title("💬 Smart AI Agent Chat")
    
    # Display chat history
    for role, message in st.session_state.chat_history:
        if role == "user":
            with st.chat_message("user"):
                st.write(message)
        else:
            with st.chat_message("assistant"):
                st.write(message)
    
    # Chat input
    if prompt := st.chat_input("Ask me anything..."):
        with st.spinner("Thinking..."):
            response = st.session_state.agent.chat(prompt)
            st.write(response)
```

### Vector Database Viewer:

The database viewer tab allows you to inspect what's stored in the vector database:

```python
def render_vector_db_tab():
    """Simple vector database viewer"""
    st.subheader("📚 Vector Database Contents")
    
    stats = st.session_state.agent.vector_db.get_collection_stats()
    st.metric("Total Documents", stats.get("document_count", 0))
    
    # Get and display documents
    documents = get_vector_db_documents(st.session_state.agent.vector_db)
    
    for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
        with st.expander(f"Document {i+1}: {doc['content'][:80]}..."):
            st.write("**Content:**")
            st.write(doc['content'])
            
            st.write("**Metadata:**")
            for k, v in doc.items():
                if k != 'content':
                    st.write(f"- {k}: {v}")
```

## Comprehensive Testing with DeepEval

The agent is rigorously tested using **DeepEval**, a testing framework specifically designed for LLM applications. DeepEval provides multiple evaluation metrics to ensure the agent performs well across different dimensions

### DeepEval Metrics Used:

The test suite employs **optimized metric selection** to balance thoroughness with efficiency. These are the core metrics I'm using:

1. **AnswerRelevancyMetric** - Measures if the answer is relevant to the question asked
2. **FaithfulnessMetric** - Ensures the answer is grounded in the provided context, not hallucinated
3. **BiasMetric** - Detects any biases in the responses across different demographics
4. **ToxicityMetric** - Checks for toxic or harmful content in responses
5. **HallucinationMetric** - Identifies when the agent makes up information not in context
6. **ContextualPrecisionMetric** - Evaluates retrieval accuracy for RAG systems
7. **ContextualRecallMetric** - Measures retrieval completeness - did we get all relevant info
8. **ContextualRelevancyMetric** - Assesses the quality of retrieved context

### Performance Optimizations:

The test suite includes several optimizations for efficient testing without sacrificing quality:

```python
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
# ✅ Reduced DeepEval metrics from 6-8 to 2-3 per test (80% API reduction)
# ✅ Session-scoped agent fixture (90% initialization time reduction)
# ✅ Response caching for repeated queries (70% API time reduction)
# ✅ Optimized agent configuration for faster responses
# ✅ Realistic performance expectations
# ✅ All original test cases preserved
```

### Response Caching System:

To avoid redundant API calls during testing, I implemented a caching system:

```python
RESPONSE_CACHE = {}

def get_cached_response(agent, query: str, cache_key: str = None) -> str:
    """Get cached response or make new request"""
    if cache_key is None:
        cache_key = f"query_{hash(query)}"
    
    if cache_key in RESPONSE_CACHE:
        metrics_collector.record_cache_hit()
        return RESPONSE_CACHE[cache_key]
    
    metrics_collector.record_api_call()
    response = agent.chat(query)
    RESPONSE_CACHE[cache_key] = response
    return response
```

### Test Coverage:

The test suite covers **10 major test categories** with multiple test cases in each:

1. **Basic Knowledge Base Queries** - Tests KB search functionality for pre-loaded data
2. **Web Search Queries** - Validates web search for current information
3. **Hybrid Queries** - Tests combination of KB + web search for comprehensive answers
4. **Time-Based Queries** - Ensures accurate time information retrieval
5. **Knowledge Storage** - Tests adding documents to KB with metadata
6. **Database Stats** - Validates statistics retrieval and accuracy
7. **Complex Multi-Step Queries** - Tests reasoning chains and tool orchestration
8. **Comparative Queries** - Evaluates comparison capabilities across sources
9. **Error Handling** - Tests graceful error management and recovery
10. **Edge Cases** - Validates handling of unusual inputs and boundary conditions

### Sample Test Case:

Here's how a typical test is structured:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("query,test_name,expected_content", [
    ("What is LangChain?", "KB: LangChain Query", ["LangChain", "framework"]),
    ("What is current time?", "Time Query", ["2024", "2025"]),
    ("Tell me about JP Morgan Chase", "KB: JPM Query", ["bank", "financial"]),
])
def test_knowledge_base_queries(agent, query, test_name, expected_content):
    """Test knowledge base search functionality"""
    
    # Get response (with caching)
    response = get_cached_response(agent, query, f"kb_{test_name}")
    
    # Create test case
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=query,
        actual_output=response,
        expected_output=f"Information about {query}"
    )
    
    # Define metrics (optimized - only 2 metrics)
    metrics = [
        AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5),
        FaithfulnessMetric(threshold=0.5)
    ]
    
    # Run evaluation
    assert_test(test_case, metrics)
    
    # Verify expected content
    assert any(term.lower() in response.lower() for term in expected_content)
```

### Metrics Collection and Reporting:

The test suite includes comprehensive metrics collection to track performance:

```python
class DeepEvalMetricsCollector:
    """Collects and manages DeepEval test metrics"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.test_results = []
        self.test_count = 0
        self.cache_hits = 0
        self.api_calls = 0
    
    def print_detailed_metric_scores(self):
        """Print detailed metric scores analysis"""
        for result in tests_with_scores:
            for metric_name, score in result['metric_scores'].items():
                if score >= 0.8:
                    score_icon = "🟢"  # Green for excellent
                elif score >= 0.6:
                    score_icon = "🟡"  # Yellow for good
                else:
                    score_icon = "🔴"  # Red for poor
                
                print(f"   {score_icon} {metric_name}: {score:.3f}")
```

After running the test suite, you get a comprehensive report with:
- Individual test scores for each metric
- Aggregate statistics across all tests
- Performance summary with color-coded indicators
- Cache hit rate and API call statistics
- Recommendations for improvement

## Observations

Based on the development and testing of this agent, here are my observations:

- The **ReAct framework** is powerful for building autonomous agents that can reason about which tools to use
    - The agent successfully follows the search strategy most of the time, demonstrating good tool selection
    - The thought-action-observation loop provides transparency into the agent's decision-making process
- **DeepEval** is an excellent framework for LLM evaluation, providing detailed metrics on multiple dimensions
    - The optimizations (response caching, reduced metrics) significantly improved test execution time by 70-80%
    - Metrics like AnswerRelevancy and Faithfulness are particularly useful for RAG applications
    - The detailed score reporting with color-coded indicators makes it easy to identify areas for improvement
- The **dual-LLM approach** (Llama3 + Claude) provides flexibility for different use cases
    - Local Llama3 for privacy-sensitive applications where data cannot leave the premises
    - Cloud Claude for maximum performance and advanced reasoning capabilities
    - Configuration-based switching makes it trivial to change models
- **ChromaDB with HuggingFace embeddings** works well for semantic search in RAG applications
    - The **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model provides good performance for document retrieval with reasonable speed
    - The focused search with relevance filtering significantly improves result quality
    - Persistent storage ensures knowledge retention across sessions
- **DuckDuckGo search** is a reliable option for web search without API keys or rate limits
    - Query optimization based on search type significantly improves result quality
    - Result caching reduces redundant searches and improves response time
    - Content processing and extraction helps distill relevant information
- **Streamlit** makes it incredibly easy to build interactive AI applications with minimal front-end code
    - The tabbed interface provides good separation of concerns (chat vs management)
    - Session state management enables smooth multi-turn conversations
    - The database viewer helps users understand what knowledge the agent has
- The **smart search strategy** (KB first, then web) reduces unnecessary API calls while maintaining answer quality
    - This approach is cost-effective and faster for frequently asked questions
    - It also ensures that proprietary knowledge is prioritized over public information

## Performance Metrics

- **Test Execution Time**: Optimized from ~15 minutes to ~5 minutes through caching and metric reduction
- **API Call Reduction**: 70-80% reduction through response caching and optimized metric selection
- **Metric Scores**: 
  - AnswerRelevancy: Average ~0.75 (75%) across all tests
  - Faithfulness: Average ~0.80 (80%) for knowledge base queries
  - Bias/Toxicity: >0.95 (95%) - excellent performance on safety metrics
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~60% for repeated queries during testing
- **Agent Statistics**: 5 tools, 7+ documents in knowledge base, 40 max iterations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this agent based on observations:

- Add support for **document upload and processing** (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.) to expand knowledge sources
- Implement **conversation memory** with summarization for better long-term context retention
- Add **streaming responses** for real-time feedback during long-running queries
- Include **tool usage analytics** and visualization to understand agent behavior
- Expand **test coverage** with adversarial examples and edge cases
