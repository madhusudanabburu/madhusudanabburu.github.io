# Read Me

Hello Reader, 

Glad that you're here. I've made a honest attempt to document some of the learnings that I have encountered with LLM, Machine Learning, Python and Kubeflow stack. It's intended at viewers who are beginners **not experts** and helps them setup their workspace and develop AI and Data Science based projects using either **Jupyter Notebooks** or **Kubeflow Pipelines**. 

All of this can be done locally on a laptop? Yes ! Of course, you would need a better performing one - **I use a MacBook M2 Max with 32 GB of Memory and 12C CPU, 30C GPU with 2 TB of storage**.

Please follow the steps in this order to setup your own workspace where you can try and experience running an LLM locally or Machine Learning pipelines albeit with test data and understand what would be needed when you are ready to fly on the cloud !

One more point, this is a static site built using [Vuepress](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/) and I've enabled Google Analytics to collect some basic demographic information (non personal) of the visitors. If you're not comfortable with me viewing it, please feel free to exit the site
